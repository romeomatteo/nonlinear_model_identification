2. Process/Description:

The process is a liquid-satured steam heat exchanger, where water is
heated by pressurized saturated steam through a copper tube.  The
output variable is the outlet liquid temperature. The input variables
are the liquid flow rate, the steam temperature, and the inlet liquid
temperature.  In this experiment the steam temperature and the inlet
liquid temperature are kept constant to their nominal values.

3. Sampling time:

  1 s 

4. Number of samples:

  4000 

5. Inputs:

  q: liquid flow rate 

6. Outputs:

  th: outlet liquid temperature

8. Known properties/peculiarities:

The heat exchanger process is a significant benchmark for nonlinear
control design purposes, since it is characterized by a non minimum
phase behaviour.  In the references cited above the control problem of
regulating the output temperature of the liquid-satured steam heat
exchanger by acting on the liquid flow rate is addressed, and both
direct and inverse identifications of the data are performed.
